The following script is a vectorized Python script using code2vec. I need you to understand its structure and,
based on it and the input of the script, determine the best set of parameters for a caching mechanism to be 
applied on it. The parameters are as follows:

m1: Hashing => represents how each function of the algorithm will be hashed for bucketizing it on a database. 
The values of m1 are: md5, xxhash and murmur

m2: storage mechanism: The storage method for the functions. Its values are: db (storage occurring on database),
file (storage occurring on database) and db-file for a mix of both

m3: Memory forms: may assume the following values
    =>ad      : original version with some bug fixes and instrumentation, all data are stored directly in the database.
    =>1d-ow   : one dicionary (1d), only write (ow), 1st implementation of dictionary: new data is added to the dictionary only when cache miss occur and the function decorated with @deterministic is executed.
    =>1d-ad   : one dicionary (1d), all data loaded at the begining (ad), 2nd implementation of dictionary (uses 1 dictionary): at the begining of the execution all the data cached is loaded to the dictonary before the user script starts to run.
    =>2d-ad   : two dicionaries (2d), all data loaded at the begining (ad), 3rd implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): at the begining of the execution all the data cached is loaded to the dictionary DATA_DICTIONARY before the user script starts to run. When cache miss occurs and a function decorated with @deterministic is processed, its result is stored in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY. This way, only the elements of NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are added to the database at the end of the execution.
    =>2d-ad-t : two dicionaries (2d), all data loaded at the begining with a thread (ad-t), 4th implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): at the begining of the execution a thread is started to load all the data cached in the database to the dictionary DATA_DICTIONARY. When cache miss occurs and a function decorated with @deterministic is processed, its result is stored in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY. Only the elements of NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are added to the database at the end of the execution but it is possible that some elements in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are already in the database due to the concurrent execution of the experiment and the thread that populates DATA_DICTIONARY.
    =>2d-ad-f : two dicionaries (2d), all data loaded at the begining of a function(ad-f), 5th implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): when @deterministic is executed a select query is created to the database to bring all results of the function decorated with @deterministic stored in the cache. A list of functions already inserted to the dictionary is maintained to avoid unecessary querys to the database. The results are then stored in the dictionary DATA_DICTIONARY. When cache miss occurs and a function decorated with @deterministic is processed, its result is stored in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY. This way, only the elements of NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are added to the database at the end of the execution.
    =>2d-ad-ft: two dicionaries (2d), all data loaded at the begining of a function with a thread (ad-ft), 6th implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): when @deterministic is executed a select query is created to the database to bring all results of the function decorated with @deterministic stored in the cache. A list of functions already inserted to the dictionary is maintained to avoid unecessary querys to the database. The results of the query are stored in the dictionary DATA_DICTIONARY by a thread. When cache miss occurs and a function decorated with @deterministic is processed, its result is stored in NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY. This way, only the elements of NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY are added to the database at the end of the execution.
    =>2d-lz   : two dicionaries (2d), lazy mode (lz), 7th implementation of dictionary (uses 2 dictionaries): new data is added to DATA_DICTIONARY when cache hit occurs (LAZY approach) and new data is added to NEW_DATA_DICTIONARY when cache miss occur and the function decorated with @deterministic is executed.

here are some examples for you to contextualize:

Also notice the format of the output. It should be exactly like that, without any extra tokens whatsoever, just the answer. Now, please
